# tables
Building a modern, serverless web application is not always easy. 

There are a number of design decisions to make, not least of which is the choice of database service.
Amazon DynamoDB provides developers with a fast, flexible, purpose-built serverless database service 
that can be easily integrated into an existing web application.

Here is a summary of the full workshop. Participants will:

1. Clone this repository.
1. Deploy MySQL and DynamoDB tables. 
1. Deploy a default React web app to localhost:3000.
1. Update the app to add calls to MySQL.
1. Test the application's read and write features.
1. Update the data access functions to use DynamoDB instead.
